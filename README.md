## Introduction
As the new larger ATC24 servers are in beta, levels of traffic begin to rise on ATC24. Dan's ATC24 Slot Manger is a software designed to help tower controllers keep track of their actions and aid in departure seperation on ATC24.

## Main Features
- Ability to add in aircraft callsigns in correct order
- Automatically move up takeoff queue when an aircraft is cleared for a departure
- Separation timer and notification when complete
- Easy UI to allow users to revert any aircraft cleared for departure by accident

# How to Use
## Adding Aircraft to The Queue
You can add up to 10 aircraft into the takeoff queue in the slot manager. To add in an aircraft, type in your callsign on the left and click the <i> ADD TO QUEUE </i> button to add it to the queue. The callsign will then be added to the first slot available for the queue, and will be given a status of <i> TAXI. </i>

## Departing an Aircraft
When the <i> DEPART </i> status is selected on an aircraft, the callsign will automtically be removed and added to the departure list for you to admire. The takeoff queue will also move up, replacing the aircraft.

## Separation Timer
In many international airports, there is a timer that separates each departure to allow for wake turbulence separation or for the aircraft in front to get far enough away in the event that the aircraft behind has an extremely high performance.
