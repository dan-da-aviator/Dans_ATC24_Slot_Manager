## Introduction
As the new larger ATC24 servers are in beta, levels of traffic begin to rise on ATC24. Dan's ATC24 Slot Manger is a software designed to help tower controllers keep track of their actions and aid in departure seperation on ATC24. 

## Main Features
- Up to 10 slots for you to add in aircraft to the takeoff queue
- Tracking of what each aircraft has been cleared to do (eg. lineup)
- Automatic removal of any aircraft cleared for departure
- Integrated departure separation timer for spacing out deparutres. Includes audible notifications
- 'Revert' button which recalls the last aircraft cleared for departure (in case you made a mistake)

# Instructions on How to Use
## Adding in Aircraft to the Queue
Use the textbox and the <i> ADD TO QUEUE </i> button to add in aircraft to the takeoff queue. Every time you enter in a new aircraft it will be added into the last position of the queue. Adding in a new aircraft will open up the dropdown menu which will allow you to keep track of the aircraft's status.

## Departing an Aircraft <br>
When the <i> DEPART </i> index is selected inside the dropdown menu, the application will automatically remove the aircraft and move the entire queue up below it. Please be aware that <b> aircraft that aren't first in queue can be departed. </b> I mainly included this feature because in some cases the aircraft that isn't first in queue is not ready for departure, which puts the rest of the aircraft in front until they are.

<b> Separation Timer </b> <br>
After departing an aircraft, the separation timer will begin. This timer is for 1 minute and 30 seconds and will beep 3 times when finshed unless you have the sound effects disabled. 

<b> - May I suggest that in order to keep the operations somewhat quick, that you do not delay the selection of <i> DEPART </i> after clearing an aircraft for takeoff. This timer is aimed for 1 minute, and the extra 30 seconds is to cover the time between clearing the aircraft for takeoff over voice and the takeoff roll itself - </b>

## Reverting Departures
In the event that you accidentally select the <i> DEPART </i> index in the selection menu, you can simply press the <i> RECALL LAST DEPARTURE </i> button to return the queue to its previous state.
